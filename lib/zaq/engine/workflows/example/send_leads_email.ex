defmodule Zaq.Engine.Workflows.UseCases.SendLeadsEmail do
  @moduledoc """
  Workflow use case: send a personalised email to each lead dispatched by
  `IdentifyLeadsFromGoogleSheet` / `GenerateCompanyContext`.

  Triggered by: `craft_email` event (dispatched as a machine/actorless `Zaq.Event`
  to :engine, so the run carries `skip_permissions: true`). The event payload
  (= the Google Sheet row) is the initial input to the run.

  ## The `start` namespace (trigger payload contract)

  The trigger payload is kept for the whole run in the persistent `start`
  namespace — a virtual origin node whose "output" is the row that triggered the
  run. Any edge `mapping` (or `{{start.<field>}}` placeholder) can read a field
  from it via a `start.<field>` dotted path, exactly as it reads a real upstream
  node's output (e.g. `draft_email.output`). This decouples downstream steps from
  any single node having to echo the row: `start.sequence`, `start.row_index`, and
  `start.company context content` below come straight from the trigger.

  DAG (linear):
    ensure_person
      → build_history            ← History — the ensured lead's own conversation,
                                    matched by person_id AND the email topic
                                    (query = start.email topic, search_in: title)
      → check_last_message_date  ← Workflow.Condition — recency gate; proceeds only
                                    when the last message is nil or older than 3 days
                                    (on_fail: continue → routes on `passed`)
      → build_agent_context      ← Workflow.Concat (list mode) — seeds an agent
                                    message array: a system turn + prior history
      → draft_email              ← RunAgent(agent_id) — writes the email BODY,
                                    seeded with `context` from build_agent_context.list
      → review_email             (human-in-the-loop)
      → send_email               ← NotifyPerson — subject = start.email topic + agent body
      → update_history           ← PersistMessageHistory — records the sent message
      → increment_email_state    ← Workflow.Increment — bumps the sequence counter
      → build_range              ← Workflow.Concat — concatenates the A1 range string
      → build_values             ← Workflow.Concat — wraps the value as a [[value]] matrix
      → update_sheet_row         ← UpdateSheetValues range mode (range/values)

  ## Recency gate (`check_last_message_date`)

  The `Condition` node runs in `on_fail: "continue"` (routing) mode and evaluates
  `total.last_message_date >= today - 3d` (datetime). That is `true` only for a
  real, recent date; both `nil` (no history) and "older than 3 days" coerce to
  `false`. The outgoing edge fires on `passed == false`, so the run proceeds for
  the nil/stale cases and stops (no outgoing edge) when the last message is recent.

  Row shape expected from the trigger (each field readable as `start.<field>`):
    %{
      "email"                   => "lead@example.com",
      "name"                    => "John Doe",
      "company"                 => "Acme Corp",
      "language"                => "french" | "english", # → start.language (email language)
      "company context content" => "…company summary…",  # → start.company context content
      "email topic"             => "…subject…",  # → start.email topic (subject/history query/topic)
      "sequence"                => 2,        # current sequence counter  → start.sequence
      "row_index"               => 5         # 1-based sheet row number   → start.row_index
    }
